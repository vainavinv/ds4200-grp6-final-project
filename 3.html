          This figure shows the distribution of average glucose levels separated by those who have had a stroke and who have not had a stroke. The data has been filtered to only include those over the age of 16.
          Research shows that the typical glucose range for healthy adults is between 70-100 mg/dL. For the adults who have not had a stroke, the IQR range is from 77.29 - 114.2 mg/dL and the majority of that is within the typical range.
          For the adults who have had a stroke, the IQR range is from 80.28 to 196.8 mg/dL.The median glucose level for the "Had Stroke" group, 105.92 mg/dL,
          is notably higher than the "No Stroke" group, 91.85 md/dL, indicating a potential association between elevated glucose levels and stroke risk.
          It is actually outside of the range and many more individuals from the group that had a stroke exceed this range than those from the group that have not had a stroke. There are also some extreme high values in the "Had Stroke" group,
          suggesting that very elevated glucose levels may be linked to stroke occurrence. Overall, the data implies that higher glucose levels are more common in individuals who have experienced a stroke.
