        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Our project is about the correlation of different risk factors and stroke. Stroke is a leading cause of disability and mortality and can affect anyone, making it a large public health concern.
          Our chosen dataset contains both modifiable factors like work type and smoking status, and non-modifiable factors, such as age and gender, and we have conducted analysis on the correlation of each of those.
          We hope that our project will identify patterns that may help in risk assessment and prevention strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have analyzed a dataset from Kaggle that has data from 5,110 people on their health information and if they have had a stroke. The data covers a wide variety of ages, from babies to people in their 80s, and many different risk factors.
          There are 11 different attributes: three numerical, which are age, average glucose level, and bmi, and eight categorical, which are gender, hypertension status, heart disease status, marriage status, work type, residence type, smoking status, and stroke status.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Age emerges as one of the most significant risk factors, with stroke incidence dramatically increasing after age 55 and continuing to rise with each subsequent decade, reaching over 21% by age 80-85.
          This aligns with what weâ€™ve learned from the research study on aging and ischemic stroke. Meanwhile for glucose levels, in the Average Glucose Level by Stroke Status boxplot, the glucose levels are higher among the patients who have had strokes,
          agreeing with the reference articles on blood glucose in acute stroke and hyperglycemia in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The boxplot demonstrates that stroke patients tend to have glucose values well above the typical healthy range. Additionally, lifestyle factors also appear to have some effect on stroke
          status, such as whether a patient smokes or not, as shown by the side-by-side bar plots and sankey diagram. People with both heart disease and hypertension have a stroke prevalence of almost 19%, compared to just 2.81% among those with neither condition. Overall, these visualizations provide insights
          on how health and lifestyle risk factors may increase the probability of getting a stroke. To help minimize the risk of stroke, people should monitor and manage blood glucose levels, especially after age 50. Regular testing and maintaining glucose in the healthy range (70-100 mg/dL) should be prioritized.
          People should pay extra attention when approaching age 55, when risk begins rising significantly. Former smokers should remain vigilant about stroke risk despite quitting because they have the highest percentage of having had stroke among all the people surveyed with different smoking statuses.
