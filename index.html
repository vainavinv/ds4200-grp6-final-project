        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Our project is about the correlation of different risk factors and stroke. Stroke is a leading cause of disability and mortality and can affect anyone, making it a large public health concern.
          Our chosen dataset contains both modifiable factors like work type and smoking status, and non-modifiable factors, such as age and gender, and we have conducted analysis on the correlation of each of those.
          We hope that our project will identify patterns that may help in risk assessment and prevention strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have analyzed a dataset from Kaggle that has data from 5,110 people on their health information and if they have had a stroke. The data covers a wide variety of ages, from babies to people in their 80s, and many different risk factors.
          There are 11 different attributes: three numerical, which are age, average glucose level, and bmi, and eight categorical, which are gender, hypertension status, heart disease status, marriage status, work type, residence type, smoking status, and stroke status.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          From the visualizations we’ve created, the observed risk factors with the greatest effect on whether a 
          patient experiences a stroke or not appears to be average glucose level and age. As shown by the percent
          of stroke by age group histogram and the interactive scatterplot of average glucose level and BMI colored 
          by stroke, the risk of getting a stroke significantly increases around 55, which aligns with what we’ve 
          learned from the research study on aging and ischemic stroke. Meanwhile for glucose levels, in the Average 
          Glucose Level by Stroke Status boxplot, you can see that the glucose levels are higher among the patients 
          with stroke, agreeing with the reference articles on blood glucose in acute stroke and hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia 
          in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Additionally, lifestyle factors also appear to have some effect on stroke 
          status, such as whether a patient smokes or not, as shown by the side-by-side bar plots, as well as the effects 
          shown by the risk factors in our drop-down selection visualization. Overall, these visualizations provide insights 
          on how health and lifestyle risk factors may increase the probability of getting a stroke, which could help patients
          take steps in the future to minimize the variables that have a higher correlation to stroke.
