        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Our project is about the correlation of different risk factors and stroke. Stroke is a leading cause of disability and mortality and can affect anyone, making it a large public health concern.
          Our chosen dataset contains both modifiable factors like work type and smoking status, and non-modifiable factors, such as age and gender, and we have conducted analysis on the correlation of each of those.
          We hope that our project will identify patterns that may help in risk assessment and prevention strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have analyzed a dataset from Kaggle that has data from 5,110 people on their health information and if they have had a stroke. The data covers a wide variety of ages, from babies to people in their 80s, and many different risk factors.
          There are 11 different attributes: three numerical, which are age, average glucose level, and bmi, and eight categorical, which are gender, hypertension status, heart disease status, marriage status, work type, residence type, smoking status, and stroke status.
