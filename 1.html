        <h3>Stroke Status vs Residence Type and Work Type</h3>
        <div class="visualization-container" style="margin-left: 6em">

        <p>
          This sankey diagram displays stroke status across work types and residence types.
          <br>
          <br>
          Key observations:
          <br>
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>- Urban residents: 94.1% have not had a stroke, while approximately 5.9% have experienced a stroke</li>
          <li>- Rural residents: 94.9% of rural residents have not had strokes, while approximately 5.1% have experienced a stroke</li>
          <li>- Self-employed individuals show the highest stroke prevalence at 7.9% (meaning 92.1% have not had a stroke)</li>
          <li>- Private sector workers have a stroke rate of 5.1% (94.9% without stroke)</li>
          <li>- Government employees demonstrate a slightly lower stroke rate at 5% (95% without stroke)</li>
          <li>- Never worked category shows 0% stroke cases (100% without stroke)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <br>
          While this shows variations in stroke prevalence across work types, these differences 
          are relatively low (only a maximum of about 3% difference among adults). The data 
          reveals minimal difference in stroke rates between urban and rural settings, 
          suggesting geographical location has little impact on stroke occurrence.
