  This interactive figure displays stroke status across work types and residence types.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key observations:
  <br>
</p>

<ul>
  <li> - "Self-employed" individuals show highest stroke prevalence with 25 records of "Rural, Stroke" (about 3.2%) and 28 records of "Urban, Stroke" (about 3.6%)</li>
  <li> - "Private" sector has a good amount of stroke cases with 61 records of "Rural, Stroke" (about 2.2%) and 66 records of "Urban, Stroke" (about 2.3%)</li>
  <li> - "Govt_job" workers show moderate stroke rates with 13 records of "Rural, Stroke" (2%) and 15 records of "Urban, Stroke" (about 2.4%)</li>
  <li> - "Children" demonstrate almost no stroke occurrence, only 1 record (0.15%)</li>
  <li> - "Never_worked" has no stroke cases (0%)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <br>
  While this shows slight variations in stroke prevalence across work types, these differences are relatively low (only about a 1% difference among adults). Additionally, the consistent pattern across rural and urban settings suggests residence type has minimal impact on stroke occurrence (with there only being a very small difference in rural and urban stroke cases). The most significant contrast is between adults and children, reinforcing that age remains a dominant factor in stroke risk. The small variations between work categories might reflect age distribution differences rather than occupation-specific risks, as older individuals are more likely to be self-employed. This interactive tool helps visualize these subtle patterns that might otherwise be difficult to detect.
