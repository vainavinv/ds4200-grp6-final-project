          These figures are scatterplots of BMI plotted against average glucose level, 
          the first figure shows those who have not had a stroke and the second shows
          those who have had a stroke, with an interactive slider that shows the data 
          based on age range. While a trend was not observed between average glucose 
          levels and BMI in both charts, as the max age is increased in the chart for 
          those with stroke, there's a noticeably sharp increase between setting the 
          age range from 55 to 60. This may indicate that once age hits a certain 
          point, the probability of getting a stroke significantly increases. 
          However, for the chart showing those who havenâ€™t had a stroke, there 
          seems to be no apparent trend as the age range increases.
