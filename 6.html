          This figure is a scatterplot of BMI plotted against average glucose level, with each point color-coded
          by those who have and do not have stroke, with an interactive slider that shows the data based on age range. 
          While a trend was not observed between average glucose levels and BMI, as the max age is increased, the number 
          of stroke cases is shown to increase, with a noticeable sharp increase between setting the age range from 55 to 60. 
          This may indicate that once age hits a certain point, the probability of getting a stroke significantly increases
