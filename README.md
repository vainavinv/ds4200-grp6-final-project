1. We chose to create a Sankey diagram to visualize the relationships between residence type, stroke status, and work type because it effectively shows the flow of data across multiple categorical variables. This approach allows us to trace pathways from residential types (urban/rural) through stroke status (stroke/no stroke) to work types. The width of each flow band represents the relative proportion of people in each pathway, making it easy to identify predominant patterns. The color coding helps distinguish different originating categories. This visualization enables us to explore potential socioeconomic factors in stroke occurrence.

2. To compare the proportion of those with stroke across different age groups, we created a barplot where the bins are the ages in 5 year intervals, and was a good fit to show the distribution of the categorical variable, having or not having stroke. This allows us to see how the likelihood of getting a stroke changes at different ages, and helps pinpoint specific age ranges where the percentage of stroke is much higher or suddenly increases.

3. We chose to create a side by side boxplot for the stroke status vs glucose level because the stroke status is a categorical variable and the glucose level is a continuous variable, which a boxplot is appropriate for. The marked area that is highlighted and labeled is to provide context for interpreting the data. Glucose level has a range that is considered healthy, so it’s useful to consider when plotting.

4. For examining heart disease and hypertension, our dataset had them as categorical variables of whether someone had it or not. We chose the side by side barplot because stroke status is also categorical. We also plotted heart disease and hypertension together and split up because the papers we referred to suggested there could be a correlation between them. By displaying all of the options together, we could look at if either of them had any effect on stroke. The bars are colored separately to make it easier to tell them apart.

5. For examining the relationship between stroke status and smoking status, we created a stacked bar chart because both variables are categorical. We used the percentage of people on the y-axis to normalize the data and make comparison easier across smoking categories. Blue bars represent people without strokes while orange bars represent people with strokes to provide clear visual distinction. By displaying all of the options together, we could look at if smoking status had any effect on stroke occurrence. The bars are colored separately to make it easier to tell them apart. This visualization allows us to examine whether different smoking statuses (formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes) correlate with stroke occurrence rates. The percentages are labeled directly on the bars to provide precise values for analysis.

6. To observe any possible relationship between average glucose level and BMI on stroke, as well as how age affects these variables, we created two scatterplots. By using a slider to select for the age range of data shown, it allows the user to see the change in the spread of data for both those with stroke and no stroke as the age range changes. This makes it easier to see any sudden changes in the density of stroke cases, as well as the most concentrated areas of average glucose and BMI based on age.
