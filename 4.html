        <h3>Stroke Status vs Heart Disease and Hypertension Status</h3>

          This figure shows the distribution of stroke status across different medical 
          risk categories. Among those with both heart disease and hypertension, 81.03% 
          of individuals have not had a stroke, while 18.97% have experienced a stroke. 
          For those with heart disease only, 84.32% have not had a stroke and 15.68% 
          have had a stroke. Among individuals with hypertension only, 87.53% have 
          not had a stroke and 12.47% have had a stroke. Of those with neither risk 
          factor, 97.19% have not had a stroke and only 2.81% have had a stroke. 
          The chart reveals a clear pattern of stroke risk across these categories. 
          Individuals with both heart disease and hypertension have the highest 
          stroke prevalence (18.97%), followed by those with heart disease only 
          (15.68%), then those with hypertension only (12.47%), with the lowest 
          rate among those with neither condition (2.81%). This suggests a strong 
          association between these risk factors and stroke occurrence, with an 
          additive effect when both factors are present. Overall, this demonstrates 
          that these conditions significantly increase stroke risk (heart disease more 
          than hypertension), with individuals having neither risk factor showing 
          substantially lower stroke prevalence compared to those with one or both 
          conditions.
