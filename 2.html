        <h3>Stroke Status by Age Group</h3>

          This figure shows the distribution of stroke percentages across 17 different age groups (the number of people who have had strokes divided by the total number of people, for each age group).
          Each age group spans 5 years, from the youngest at 0–5 years old to the oldest at 80–85 years old. Almost all age groups younger than 45-50 years old have a stroke percentage that is less than 1%.
          The range of the data is from 0.0% to 21.4%. The distribution of the variable is highly right-skewed, with stroke risk increasing sharply in older age groups.
          The 80–85 age group stands out as having the highest stroke percentage (21.4%). There are no apparent outliers, and the data clearly highlights age as a significant factor in stroke prevalence.
