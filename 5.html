        <h3>Stroke Status vs Smoking Status</h3>

          This figure shows the distribution of stroke status across different smoking 
          categories. In the "formerly smoked" group, 93.19% of individuals have not 
          had a stroke, while 6.81% have experienced a stroke. For those who "never 
          smoked," 95.46% have not had a stroke and 4.54% have had a stroke. Among 
          current smokers, 94.71% have not had a stroke and 5.29% have had a stroke. 
          This reveals that former smokers have the highest stroke prevalence (6.81%), 
          followed by current smokers (5.29%), with non-smokers having the lowest rate 
          (4.54%). This suggests an association between smoking history and stroke risk, 
          with both current and former smoking status showing higher stroke rates and 
          lower no stroke rates compared to never smoking. The higher rate among former 
          smokers might be due to various factors, such as individuals smoking for a 
          longer time frame, quitting after experiencing health issues, or even age 
          differences between the groups. Overall, the data indicates smoking as a 
          potential risk factor for stroke.
