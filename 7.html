          Conclusion:
          <br>
         From the visualizations we’ve created, the observed risk factors with the greatest effect on whether a patient experiences a 
          stroke or not appears to be average glucose level and age. As shown by the percent of stroke by age group histogram and the 
          interactive scatterplot of average glucose level and BMI colored by stroke, the risk of getting a stroke significantly increases
          around 55, which aligns with what we’ve learned from the research study on aging and ischemic stroke. Meanwhile for glucose levels, 
          in the Average Glucose Level by Stroke Status boxplot, you can see that the glucose levels are higher among the patients with stroke, 
          agreeing with the reference articles on blood glucose in acute stroke and hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia in patients with acute ischemic 
          stroke. Additionally, lifestyle factors also appear to have some effect on stroke status, such as whether a patient smokes or not, as 
          shown by the side-by-side bar plots, as well as the effects shown by the risk factors in our drop-down selection visualization. Overall, 
          these visualizations provide insights on how health and lifestyle risk factors may increase the probability of getting a stroke, which 
          could help patients take steps in the future to minimize the variables that have a higher correlation to stroke.
